<h1>Steps to increase the likelihood of success</h1>
<ul>
    
    
    
    <li>Check out other <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/resources" target="_blank"> resources</a></li>
<li>(Optional, but highly recommended) Fork <a href="https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code"> this Github repo</a> and commit to the Log daily. Follow the instructions in the repo.</li>
<li>Follow 100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot that retweets all the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. Itâ€™s a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks @amanhimself for creating it!</li>
<li>Important: Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. Itâ€™s also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (probably more :) ) right away.</li>
<li>If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)</li>
